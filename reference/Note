First give a solution even it is not so perfect, then give a better solution. Try to do first and the optimize it.


 class my_cfg extends uvm_object;
      `uvm_object_utils (my_cfg)

      virtual dut_if             vif;                          // Handle to interface
      uvm_active_passive_enum    active = UVM_ACTIVE;          // Configure Agent to be active

      uvm_verbosity m_verbosity = UVM_LOW;
      // Put in other agent parameters if required - functional coverage, 

      function new (string name = "my_cfg");
         super.new (name);
